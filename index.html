                <p>Tesla, Inc. (formerly Tesla Motors, Inc.) is an American automotive and energy company based in Palo
                    Alto, California.[7] The company specializes in electric car manufacturing and, through its
                    SolarCity subsidiary, solar panel manufacturing. It operates multiple production and assembly
                    plants, notably Gigafactory 1 near Reno, Nevada, and its main vehicle manufacturing facility at
                    Tesla Factory in Fremont, California. As of June 2018, Tesla sells the Model S, Model X and Model 3
                    vehicles, Powerwall and Powerpack batteries, solar panels, solar roof tiles, and some related
                    products.</p>

                <p>Tesla was founded in July 2003, by engineers Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning, under the name
                    Tesla Motors. The company's name was derived from physicist Nikola Tesla. In early Series A
                    funding, Tesla Motors was joined by Elon Musk, J. B. Straubel and Ian Wright, all of whom are
                    retrospectively allowed to call themselves co-founders of the company. Musk, who serves as chairman
                    and chief executive officer, said that he envisioned Tesla Motors as a technology company and
                    independent automaker, aimed at eventually offering electric cars at prices affordable to the
                    average consumer. Tesla Motors shortened its name to Tesla in February 2017.</p>

                <p class="text-center"><strong>IPO, Model S, and Model X</strong></p>
                <p> On June 29, 2010, Tesla launched its initial public offering (IPO) on NASDAQ. 13,300,000 shares of
                    common stock were issued to the public at a price of US$17.00 per share. The IPO raised US$226
                    million. Tesla began shipping its Model S sedan in June 2012. In May 2013, Tesla raised $1.02 billion ($660m
                    from bonds) partially to repay the DOE loans after their first profitable quarter.
                    In February 2014 the company sold $2 billion in bonds (to build GigaFactory 1). In August 2015
                    Tesla sold $738 million in stock (for the Model X) and in May 2016, $1.46 billion in stock ($1.26
                    billion for the Model 3).[42] As of January 29, 2016, Musk owned about 28.9 million Tesla shares, or
                    about 22% of the total. Tesla began shipping the Model X crossover SUV in September 2015.[45] Global sales of the Model S
                    reached 100,000 in December 2015.Tesla's vehicles and operations are eligible for various forms of federal and state subsidy, which it
                    was estimated in 2015 amounted to at least $30,000 for each vehicle sold, or cumulatively $4.9
                    billion.Tesla stated that its automotive branch had a gross margin of 23.1% as of 2Q 2016, and has generally
                    been above 20%. However, expenditures for expanding future production are bigger than product
                    profit, resulting in a net loss.
